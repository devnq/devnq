                        and solve programming problems together. Every Tuesday participants get the chance to sharpen
                        their skillsets, and get assistance with hard problems by working on projects in a social setting
                        with other programmers of varying experience and skills. Code club attendees are welcome to bring
                        along their own project, or find a collaborative project they can work on with others.

                        At DevNQ Hackathons teams of individuals come together for an intense 24-hour period.
                        They collaborate enthusiastically to invent new, innovative solutions to problems theyâ€™ve never
                        seen before. Hackathons are fantastic opportunities for programmers to rediscover their playfulness,
                        curiousity and passion for solving problems.
